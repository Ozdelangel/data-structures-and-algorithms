# Trees

Binary Search Tree and Binary Tree implementation
we are able to use methods to be able to traverse trees in certain order. also we are able to add to a binary search tree and see what it contains.

# find max

Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Challenge
Implement all methods that are associated with traversal, add, and contain

## find max
Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
this is an implementation
## find max
this will be an O(n) and space O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees --> n/a
