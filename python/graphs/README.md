# Graphs
Graph implementation

## Challenge
implement the necessary methods for graphs


## Approach & Efficiency
I had a lot of help from this youtube channel on the understanding of what this graph is actually doing
how the add node method just initializes an empty adjacency list for nodes to be put in

also how the add edge will put each node in the corresponding adjacency list
